The fire at 2.35am this morning at the junction of Atherley Road and Macdonald Street caused smoke to billow across parts of the building and residents of nearby houses heard what they thought was a loud bang.

What they found

A man who called police said he could not remember anything suspicious but feared for his safety if he was in the area.

He said he had been smoking outside when a large plume of smoke rolled in.

Residents said they had no idea why the fire was starting.

A fire brigade spokesman said the fire was under control about four hours after the alarm was raised.

The blaze broke out after 3am but by 4.20am was gone, his spokesman said.

Police said officers were investigating.

2: PPL=8.058, , score=-2.0872 The Trump administration is considering banning transgender individuals from serving openly in the military or taking a military promotion because it "will undermine longstanding military leadership," according to a report in Friday's Washington Post.

The Trump administration announced on Wednesday a new proposal to the Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAP) program that would bar transgender individuals from serving openly in the military without the express consent of their families. The Pentagon estimated that such policies would cost the U.S. government about $10 billion over four years. It's unclear if the current proposals would also include banning transgender service members.

The news report quoted Army leaders who said such policies would only serve to put transgender service members at additional risk of harm from their peers and their families.

A statement from the President of the United States made no mention of the proposed ban and did not explain how he would stop the current programs.

It's also unclear how the ban will affect senior-level service for transgender people already serving. Under current law, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 prohibits anyone who has reached such a level of service from ever again serving.

If you have a long hair, you can get a hold of an expert in this area and try to get a shorter strand of hair. If that won't work, you can find two or three other people, or get your hair cut a few months ago. At that point, you can try to go back and try again. You could try to get a strand of hair with just a little bit of styling on, then try again next time.

Here's the thing about how we tend to live our lives. I think one of the reasons a lot of women struggle is that they don't fully trust the quality of their own hair. They'll buy the wrong stuff, or they'll go over to a salon because they think the hair style is too much like that of the salon. So if they don't have enough confidence in the hair, they'll try to find someone who does.

"That's really unfortunate," says the former congressional aide. "But that doesn't mean he can't fix it. I understand it's embarrassing to Republicans for saying this publicly. That's not our job to go do more, get rid of it in the legislature."

A poll released this week by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that Trump's approval has dropped five points over the past year. His score among the white, working class voters that Trump claimed to appeal to fell in his first months in the White House. More than seven in 10 voters surveyed said the president was unfavorably influenced by the political and media establishment.

And even Democrats, who have consistently pushed back on Trump's presidency, are coming around. They now appear open to working together on health care and other issues, and are embracing Trump's rhetoric of bringing back jobs and building a vast middle class.

A game like Skyrim, or even Fallout, that feels like it has infinite replayability because it's a linear game will feel like the end of the world. It won't even be fun. I'm sure the Bethesda guys who made Bethesda Studios want to stop making the Fallout franchise thought about that before making Fallout 3. Because this is Bethesda's job to make fun games that make people uncomfortable. What's a fun game if you're not uncomfortable? Why would you play it?

When the Bethesda developers talk about trying to avoid making "mushy" experiences, the most commonly cited complaint is "it will make you fat." I'm sorry, this is not fair because I don't agree that games must just be pleasant. In fact, I would say that games are most useful if they make you feel uncomfortable, emotionally involved.

So if they don't have enough confidence in the hair, they'll try to find someone who does.

It's almost like asking someone to make you your hair color, and they ask you to do all of the work. And I've made hundreds of men

10 One of the biggest problems we've had as a group over the last year or so is the frustration I personally feel with the current state of the game. The constant barrage of "we can't get better players or it's our fault" and similar lines are the antithesis of what Riot should be: a creative and diverse community of talent and people trying to take a hard, smart risk to bring our game to the next level, all in the spirit of what we think is an artisanship. A lot of these frustrations came in the form of players complaining about the lack of quality in many of the games we're putting on, and we've tried to address it. What came out of this talk? Our hope was to move you over to a system where we can do something about your issues directly. That's not to say you'll magically be able to magically change what teams you're on or where you're competing, but you'll definitely see a dramatic improvement. So let's get right to it!I didn't come to this talk to write off this group of passionate people. I've had plenty of discussions recently about our roster with you guys and it's been fascinating to see where you're headed. At this point in time, we're all really close

1 The Trump administration is considering banning transgender individuals from serving openly in the military or taking a military promotion because it "will undermine longstanding military leadership," according to a report in Friday's Washington Post.

The Trump administration announced on Wednesday a new proposal to the Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAP) program that would bar transgender individuals from serving openly in the military without the express consent of their families. The Pentagon estimated that such policies would cost the U.S. government about $10 billion over four years. It's unclear if the current proposals would also include banning transgender service members.

The news report quoted Army leaders who said such policies would only serve to put transgender service members at additional risk of harm from their peers and their families.

A statement from the President of the United States made no mention of the proposed ban and did not explain how he would stop the current programs.

It's also unclear how the ban will affect senior-level service for transgender people already serving. Under current law, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 prohibits anyone who has reached such a level of service from ever again serving.

2 In 2013, the National Institutes of Health released new evidence demonstrating that the immune response to a particular vaccine can be altered by exposure to certain toxins. Specifically, the study reported that when immunized with the chickenpox virus, the body produced more antibodies to the vaccine-virus when exposed to bacteria from the gut. The vaccines were particularly potent against the bacteria that cause the condition, diarrhea-causing enterococci.

However, the question of whether the vaccine may cause adverse reactions remains an open one.

When a number of studies suggest the use of antibiotics as part of the childhood immunization schedule, some physicians question the effectiveness of the vaccine. However, a recent American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) study concluded that these drugs are no more toxic than the usual childhood drugs used.

"All of the studies have shown, however, that it is difficult to prove to a physician that a specific drug is associated with or should be prevented for a particular group … that an antibiotic used alone cannot cause harm or death."

At the end of March, the first trial of a particular vaccine, B6, on the general population was published. However, it was clear by then that the drugs used, called diphtheria toxoids, were

3 But for the moment, Trump has decided his time has passed.

To the extent that the new president feels he has no one to blame but himself for a failure that has cost tens of millions of Americans their health insurance, what else can he do?

"That's really unfortunate," says the former congressional aide. "But that doesn't mean he can't fix it. I understand it's embarrassing to Republicans for saying this publicly. That's not our job to go do more, get rid of it in the legislature."

A poll released this week by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that Trump's approval has dropped five points over the past year. His score among the white, working class voters that Trump claimed to appeal to fell in his first months in the White House. More than seven in 10 voters surveyed said the president was unfavorably influenced by the political and media establishment.

And even Democrats, who have consistently pushed back on Trump's presidency, are coming around. They now appear open to working together on health care and other issues, and are embracing Trump's rhetoric of bringing back jobs and building a vast middle class.

"I see Republicans are starting to recognize that they're not all in the same boat, but are they starting

6 The government must stop denying benefits for anyone from outside the EU without any explanation, said MEP for Strasbourg, Antonio Tajani.

At a House of Commons debate on June 27th Tajani's question related to the government's decision to exclude two-year-old children from the benefit freeze.

The government will be seeking to continue paying out the child benefit for a maximum of five full years (in case of a parent's death).

Tajani said he wants to know what the government is so worried about, since all those child benefit benefits will now be cancelled in five years, when, for example, the number of people applying for them will have dropped from 300,000 to just 25,000, meaning that at least two-thirds or almost a third of working age parents with children born outside the EU will no longer be entitled.

The government's argument

But it is impossible to explain why this is allowed without a clear explanation.

So to my question for the Minister for Health, we must ask, Why are there still more children to be stopped from receiving child benefit?

Our EU relatives, many of whom were here long before us, are still the best hope for our future.

8 So, let's just say that for every time that you want to play a game, you have to make a choice — a choice between going with what feels good or what feels realistic.

A game like Skyrim, or even Fallout, that feels like it has infinite replayability because it's a linear game will feel like the end of the world. It won't even be fun. I'm sure the Bethesda guys who made Bethesda Studios want to stop making the Fallout franchise thought about that before making Fallout 3. Because this is Bethesda's job to make fun games that make people uncomfortable. What's a fun game if you're not uncomfortable? Why would you play it?

When the Bethesda developers talk about trying to avoid making "mushy" experiences, the most commonly cited complaint is "it will make you fat." I'm sorry, this is not fair because I don't agree that games must just be pleasant. In fact, I would say that games are most useful if they make you feel uncomfortable, emotionally involved. If you feel uncomfortable, then that's the difference between a game and games made for a profit.

One thing I wanted to touch on was the idea that a good game should have an interesting narrative or plot for when it's

9 But to me, this is a case-by-case process. If you're getting your hair brown, you should try to go back three days before the experiment to see how well you are feeling. If you have a long hair, you can get a hold of an expert in this area and try to get a shorter strand of hair. If that won't work, you can find two or three other people, or get your hair cut a few months ago. At that point, you can try to go back and try again. You could try to get a strand of hair with just a little bit of styling on, then try again next time.

Here's the thing about how we tend to live our lives. I think one of the reasons a lot of women struggle is that they don't fully trust the quality of their own hair. They'll buy the wrong stuff, or they'll go over to a salon because they think the hair style is too much like that of the salon.

10 What happened

The fire at 2.35am this morning at the junction of Atherley Road and Macdonald Street caused smoke to billow across parts of the building and residents of nearby houses heard what they thought was a loud bang.

What they found

A man who called police said he could not remember anything suspicious but feared for his safety if he was in the area.

He said he had been smoking outside when a large plume of smoke rolled in.

Residents said they had no idea why the fire was starting.

A fire brigade spokesman said the fire was under control about four hours after the alarm was raised.

The blaze broke out after 3am but by 4.20am was gone, his spokesman said.

Police said officers were investigating.
